            <b class="subtitle">What is Networking Water?</b><br>
            An academic research initiative.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            <b class="subtitle">What is it about?</b><br>
            Water quality and quantity.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            <b class="subtitle">Tell me more...</b><br>
            The municipal water supply in many areas in the world is often unreliable and unsafe. This problem is hard to fix because (amongst other issues) there is a lack of data on the water supply. So, part of the solution is to collect more data. <br><br>
            Networking Water wants to see if community people can be charged with the task of collecting data on their personal water supply. In other words, can we depend on people to collect data to help resolve water problems? <br><br>
            To know this, we need volunteers to collect the data through the app that we have developed at Imperial College London, in the United Kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            <b class="subtitle">What do I have to do if I volunteer in this research?</b><br>
            Answer questions through our app or website.
        </p>
        <p> 
            <br>
            <b class="subtitle">How long do I have to participate?</b><br>
            We need you to participate <u>every day</u> for at least <u>2 weeks.</u> This is so we can have enough data to understand what's going on.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            <b class="subtitle">What questions will I be asked in the app?</b><br>
            Did you have a water cut today? How long did it last? How is your water quality today? That's all.
        </p>
        <!--

            <br>
            <b class="subtitle">I want to know if the water I receive is clean - can you help?</b><br>
            We can provide you with easy test kits. The test takes a few minutes to do, and the results appear 24 hours later. We ask that you take a picture of the results through the photo button on the app. We want to know if your water is clean too.
        </p>
        -->
        <p>
            <br>
            <b class="subtitle">What will the data be used for?</b><br>
            The research will analyse the data given from all the volunteers together, and will answer the question of whether we can depend on people to collect data on the water supply. The answer to this question will be presented to water managers.
        </p>
        <p> 
            <br>
            <b class="subtitle">Will anybody know I participated in this research?</b><br>
            No. Your responses are anonymous and confidential.
        </p>
        <p> 
            <br>
            <b class="subtitle">Why are you doing this research?</b><br>
            We hope that the data recorded by volunteers in this study will stimulate a change in the approach to managing the water problems in globally.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            <br>
            Thank you for your help.
